# Crazy Movie Gallery

This is a <b>MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) JS web app</b> to check the latest movies release online: https://crazymoviegallery.herokuapp.com/

The main features of the app :

<ul>
  <li>View a gallery of the most popular of the latest movies released in the previous month (with movie cover and movie description in French)</li>
  <li>Like or dislike a movie to keep it in your favorite movies gallery</li>
  <li>View a gallery of your favorite movies gallery</li>
</ul>

I built this app to learn about:
<ol>
  <li>Setting up a back-end server on <b>node.JS using Express framework</b></li>
  <li>Connecting to the MovieDatabase API to get the data I needed</li>
  <li>Setting up, reading and updating a <b>mongo DB with Mongoose Framework</b> to keep in memory the favorite movies</li>
  <li>Building my first <b>React</b> web app</li>
  <li>Connecing my React app to my back-end server
